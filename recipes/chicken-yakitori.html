    <h3>Inspired by Japanese street food.</h3>
    <p>Yakitori is a Japanese street food, yaki meaning "grilled" and tori meaning ”bird.” These juicy chicken skewers are tender, saucy, and perfect for enjoying on the go! 
       Today's recipe is inspired by those delicious street food flavors that you can easily recreate at home!</p>
    <p>Yakitori chicken is coated in a tasty homemade sauce, made with ingredients like soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and rice wine for a flavor that is everything from sweet to savory to tangy!</p>
