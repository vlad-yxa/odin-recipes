This is my first project in The Odin Project curriculum. 
The project is to use basic HTML skills to build a basic recipe website:

- setup a main index page
- add several links to few recipes

UPDATE: The website now includes three recipe pages in addition to the main index.html page.
Each recipe page has list of ingredients as unorganized list, and step by step instructions as organized list.
